## About
A list of stopwords for Irish (Gaeilge), suitable for use in tidy text packages such as [tidytext](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tidytext) or [tidygramr](https://github.com/cldatascience/tidygramr)

The initial list of words is based on commonly occuring words in Irish such as pronouns, prepositions, and various forms of the verb b√≠.
